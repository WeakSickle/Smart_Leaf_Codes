# Smart Leaf Codes

Some notes about the repo:

- **Main Scripts** are located in the "LILY GO T BEAM" folder. "SmartLeaf" is a relic folder while experimenting with dashboard prototypes.
- **Visual Studio Code** with platformio extension was used to build and upload files located in the main folder.
- A majority of these scripts were built founded on prebuilt architecture made by **LilyGo** in the "LilyGo-LoRa-Series" repo. Big thanks to them! (https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-LoRa-Series.git)
